# Predictive-Analysis

Welcome to the Predictive Analysis repository! 

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of various predictive analysis techniques and their implementation in Python using the scikit-learn library. The project focuses on various regression and classification algorithms, feature engineering and selection techniques, and performance evaluation metrics.So, let's dive into the world of Predictive Analysis and make the most of this repository!

## Libraries used:
1. **Pandas**

For reading the csv files

2. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**

For creating visuals and graphs for better understanding of the dataset.

Plots used are scatterplot,boxplot

3. **Scikit-Learn**

We use scikit_learn to create regression model for the data set and also to predict the values for the future values.

Scikit_learn is also used to rate the model usinf **r2_score** and **mean_squared_error**.

The accuracy of the model can be shown using the **r2_score** that was calculated at 0.98.
